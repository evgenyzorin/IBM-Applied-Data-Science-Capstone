# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
This Capstone is the 10th (final) course in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, and it actually summarizes in the form of project all materials that have been learned during this specialization.
## Project Background
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space 
age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 
9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the 
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we 
can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost 
of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning 
models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
